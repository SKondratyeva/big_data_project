This is the application that detects a watermark on images (further, it will also remove a watermark). 
Currently, it is just a draft version. 

How to use:
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/home
2. Upload a picture in jpeg/png format with a watermark
3. Click 'Upload File'
4. The service will process your image and return back another image where lighter pixels are supposed to show the place of the watermark.
